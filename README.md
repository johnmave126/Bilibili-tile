Bilibili redirector
===
OK, in fact this is not a redirector. This is my experimental UWA (Universal Windows Application). The only function this App provides is a live tile. This App supports medium, wide, and large tiles.
It will crawl the update of Bilibili Bangumi page and update the live tile accordingly(well, not exactly, the crawling work is done by scripts on a remote server, see Project https://github.com/johnmave126/Bilibili-tile-backend).

HOWTO
---------
After installing the App (to install in VS, just debug it or deploy it). Find App 'Bilibli 番剧' and pin it onto start menu. You need to run it once to activate live tile.

Roadmap
---------
If I have really really nothing to do, I may use subtiles to allow pinning different section of Bilibili on start  menu.
